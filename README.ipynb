The Awesome Conformal Prediction [repository](https://github.com/valeman/awesome-conformal-prediction) [@manokhin2022awesome] has also been a fantastic place to get started. Thanks also to [\\@aangelopoulos](https://github.com/aangelopoulos), [\\@valeman](https://github.com/valeman) and others for actively contributing to discussions on here. Quite a few people have also recently started using and contributing to the package for which I am very grateful. Finally, many thanks to Anthony Blaom ([\\@ablaom](https://github.com/ablaom)) for many helpful discussions about how to interface this package to `MLJ.jl`.\n",
