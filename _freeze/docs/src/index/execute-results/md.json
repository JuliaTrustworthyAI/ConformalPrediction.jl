It is designed to work with supervised models trained in [MLJ](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/MLJ.jl/dev/) [@blaom2020mlj]. Conformal Prediction is distribution-free, easy-to-understand, easy-to-use and model-agnostic. \n\n## 🏃 Quick Tour\n\n> First time here? Take a quick interactive [tour](https://binder.plutojl.org/v0.19.12/open?url=https%253A%252F%252Fraw.githubusercontent.com%252Fpat-alt%252FConformalPrediction.jl%252Fmain%252Fdocs%252Fpluto%252Fintro.jl) to see what this package can do: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://binder.plutojl.org/v0.19.12/open?url=https%253A%252F%252Fraw.githubusercontent.com%252Fpat-alt%252FConformalPrediction.jl%252Fmain%252Fdocs%252Fpluto%252Fintro.jl){target=\"_blank\"}\n\nThe button takes you to a [`Pluto.jl`](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl){target=\"_blank\"} 🎈 notebook hosted on [binder](https://mybinder.org/){target=\"_blank\"}. In my own experience, this may take some time to load, certainly long enough to get yourself a hot beverage ☕. Alternatively, you can run the notebook locally or skip the tour for now and read on below. \n\n### Local Tour\n\nTo run the tour locally, just clone this repo and start `Pluto.jl` as follows:\n\n```{.julia}\n] add Pluto\nusing Pluto\nPluto.run()\n```\n\nAll notebooks are contained in `docs/pluto`.\n\n## 📖 Background\n\nDon't worry, we're not about to deep-dive into methodology. But just to give you a high-level description of Conformal Prediction (CP) upfront:\n\n> Conformal prediction (a.k.a. conformal inference) is a user-friendly paradigm for creating statistically rigorous uncertainty sets/intervals for the predictions of such models. Critically, the sets are valid in a distribution-free sense: they possess explicit, non-asymptotic guarantees even without distributional assumptions or model assumptions.\n>\n> --- @angelopoulos2021gentle\n\nIntuitively, CP works under the premise of turning heuristic notions of uncertainty into rigorous uncertainty estimates through repeated sampling or the use of dedicated calibration data. \n\n![Conformal Prediction in action: prediction intervals at varying coverage rates. As coverage grows, so does the width of the prediction interval.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pat-alt/pat-alt.github.io/main/blog/posts/conformal-regression/www/medium.gif)\n\nThe animation above is lifted from a small blog [post](https://www.paltmeyer.com/blog/posts/conformal-regression/) that introduces Conformal Prediction and this package in the context of regression. It shows how the prediction interval and the test points that it covers varies in size as the user-specified coverage rate changes.\n\n## 🚩 Installation \n\nYou can install the latest stable release from the general registry:\n\n```{.julia}\nusing Pkg\nPkg.add(\"ConformalPrediction\")\n```\n\nThe development version can be installed as follows:\n\n```{.julia}\nusing Pkg\nPkg.add(url=\"https://github.com/pat-alt/ConformalPrediction.jl\")\n```\n\n## 🔍 Usage Example \n\nTo illustrate the intended use of the package, let's have a quick look at a simple regression problem. We first generate some synthetic data and then determine indices for our training and test data using [MLJ](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/MLJ.jl/dev/):\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nusing MLJ\n\n# Inputs:\nN = 600\nxmax = 3.0\nusing Distributions\nd = Uniform(-xmax, xmax)\nX = rand(d, N)\nX = reshape(X, :, 1)\n\n# Outputs:\nnoise = 0.5\nfun(X) = X * sin(X)\nε = randn(N) .* noise\ny = @.(fun(X)) + ε\ny = vec(y)\n\n# Partition:\ntrain, test = partition(eachindex(y), 0.4, 0.4, shuffle=true)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe then import a decision-tree based regressor ([`EvoTrees.jl`](https://github.com/Evovest/EvoTrees.jl)) following the standard [MLJ](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/MLJ.jl/dev/) procedure.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nEvoTreeRegressor = @load EvoTreeRegressor pkg=EvoTrees\nmodel = EvoTreeRegressor(rounds=100) \n```\n:::\n\n\nTo turn our conventional model into a conformal model, we just need to declare it as such by using `conformal_model` wrapper function. The generated conformal model instance can wrapped in data to create a *machine*. Finally, we proceed by fitting the machine on training data using the generic `fit!` method:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=4}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nusing ConformalPrediction\nconf_model = conformal_model(model; method=:jackknife_plus)\nmach = machine(conf_model, X, y)\nfit!(mach, rows=train)\n```\n:::\n\n\nPredictions can then be computed using the generic `predict` method. The code below produces predictions for the first `n` samples. Each tuple contains the lower and upper bound for the prediction interval. \n\n::: {.cell execution_count=5}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nshow_first = 5\nXtest = selectrows(X, test)\nytest = y[test]\nŷ = predict(mach, Xtest)\nŷ[1:show_first]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=6}\n```\n5-element Vector{Tuple{Float64, Float64}}:\n (0.325476135568554, 2.5420611849529986)\n (-0.8093221495344456, 1.513229072277355)\n (0.24246467414510378, 2.531848511672005)\n (-0.37629465789570005, 1.9144457517084361)\n (-0.5411423339519135, 1.712803571302072)\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFor simple models like this one, we can call a custom `Plots` recipe on our instance, fit result and data to generate the chart below:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=6}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nusing Plots\nzoom = 0\nplt = plot(mach.model, mach.fitresult, Xtest, ytest, zoom=zoom, observed_lab=\"Test points\")\nxrange = range(-xmax+zoom,xmax-zoom,length=N)\nplot!(plt, xrange, @.(fun(xrange)), lw=1, ls=:dash, colour=:black, label=\"Ground truth\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=7}\n![](index_files/figure-commonmark/cell-7-output-1.svg){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can evaluate the conformal model using the standard [MLJ](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/MLJ.jl/dev/) workflow with a custom performance measure. You can use either `emp_coverage` for the overall empirical coverage (correctness) or `ssc` for the size-stratified coverage rate (adaptiveness).\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=7}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\n_eval = evaluate!(mach; measure=[emp_coverage, ssc], verbosity=0)\ndisplay(_eval)\nprintln(\"Empirical coverage: $(round(_eval.measurement[1], digits=3))\")\nprintln(\"SSC: $(round(_eval.measurement[2], digits=3))\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n```\nPerformanceEvaluation object with these fields:\n  measure, operation, measurement, per_fold,\n  per_observation, fitted_params_per_fold,\n  report_per_fold, train_test_rows\nExtract:\n┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┬───────────┬───────\n│ measure                                                   │ operation │ meas ⋯\n├───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┼───────────┼───────\n│ emp_coverage (generic function with 1 method)             │ predict   │ 0.95 ⋯\n│ size_stratified_coverage (generic function with 1 method) │ predict   │ 0.90 ⋯\n└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┴───────────┴───────\n                                                               3 columns omitted\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nEmpirical coverage: 0.957\nSSC: 0.907\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## 📚 Read on\n\nIf after reading the usage example above you are just left with more questions about the topic, that's normal.

The former can be evaluated by looking at the empirical coverage rate, while the latter can be assessed through metrics that address the conditional coverage [@angelopoulos2021gentle]. To this end, the following metrics have been implemented:\n\n- `emp_coverage` (empirical coverage)\n- `ssc` (size-stratified coverage)\n\nThere is also a simple `Plots.jl` recipe that can be used to inspect the set sizes. In the regression case, the interval width is stratified into discrete bins for this purpose:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=10}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nbar(mach.model, mach.fitresult, X)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=11}\n![](index_files/figure-commonmark/cell-11-output-1.svg){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## 🛠 Contribute \n\nContributions are welcome!
