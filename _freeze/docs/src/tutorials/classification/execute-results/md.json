Let $(X_i, Y_i), \\ i=1,...,n$ denote our feature-label pairs and let $\\mu: \\mathcal{X} \\mapsto \\mathcal{Y}$ denote the mapping from features to labels. For illustration purposes we will use the moons dataset 🌙. Using [`MLJ.jl`](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/MLJ.jl/v0.18/) we first generate the data and split into into a training and test set:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nusing MLJ\nusing Random\nRandom.seed!(123)\n\n# Data:\nX, y = make_moons(500; noise=0.15)\nX = MLJ.table(convert.(Float32, MLJ.matrix(X)))\ntrain, test = partition(eachindex(y), 0.8, shuffle=true)\n```\n:::\n\n\nHere we will use a specific case of CP called *split conformal prediction* which can then be summarized as follows:^[In other places split conformal prediction is sometimes referred to as *inductive* conformal prediction.]\n\n1. Partition the training into a proper training set and a separate calibration set: $\\mathcal{D}_n=\\mathcal{D}^{\\text{train}} \\cup \\mathcal{D}^{\\text{cali}}$.\n2. Train the machine learning model on the proper training set: $\\hat\\mu_{i \\in \\mathcal{D}^{\\text{train}}}(X_i,Y_i)$.\n3. Compute nonconformity scores, $\\mathcal{S}$, using the calibration data $\\mathcal{D}^{\\text{cali}}$ and the fitted model $\\hat\\mu_{i \\in \\mathcal{D}^{\\text{train}}}$. \n4. For a user-specified desired coverage ratio $(1-\\alpha)$ compute the corresponding quantile, $\\hat{q}$, of the empirical distribution of nonconformity scores, $\\mathcal{S}$.\n5. For the given quantile and test sample $X_{\\text{test}}$, form the corresponding conformal prediction set: \n\n$$\nC(X_{\\text{test}})=\\{y:s(X_{\\text{test}},y) \\le \\hat{q}\\}\n$$ {#eq-set}\n\nThis is the default procedure used for classification and regression in [`ConformalPrediction.jl`](https://github.com/juliatrustworthyai/ConformalPrediction.jl). \n\nNow let's take this to our 🌙 data. To illustrate the package functionality we will demonstrate the envisioned workflow. We first define our atomic machine learning model following standard [`MLJ.jl`](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/MLJ.jl/v0.18/) conventions. Using [`ConformalPrediction.jl`](https://github.com/juliatrustworthyai/ConformalPrediction.jl) we then wrap our atomic model in a conformal model using the standard API call `conformal_model(model::Supervised; kwargs...)`. To train and predict from our conformal model we can then rely on the conventional [`MLJ.jl`](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/MLJ.jl/v0.18/) procedure again. In particular, we wrap our conformal model in data (turning it into a machine) and then fit it to the training data. Finally, we use our machine to predict the label for a new test sample `Xtest`:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\n# Model:\nKNNClassifier = @load KNNClassifier pkg=NearestNeighborModels\nmodel = KNNClassifier(;K=50) \n\n# Training:\nusing ConformalPrediction\nconf_model = conformal_model(model; coverage=.9)\nmach = machine(conf_model, X, y)\nfit!(mach, rows=train)\n\n# Conformal Prediction:\nXtest = selectrows(X, test)\nytest = y[test]\nŷ = predict(mach, Xtest)\nŷ[1]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nimport NearestNeighborModels ✔\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=4}\n```\nUnivariateFinite{Multiclass{2}}(0=>0.94)\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe final predictions are set-valued. While the softmax output remains unchanged for the `SimpleInductiveClassifier`, the size of the prediction set depends on the chosen coverage rate, $(1-\\alpha)$. \n\n::: {.cell execution_count=4}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=5}\nWhen specifying a coverage rate very close to one, the prediction set will typically include many (in some cases all) of the possible labels. Below, for example, both classes are included in the prediction set when setting the coverage rate equal to $(1-\\alpha)$=1.0. This is intuitive, since high coverage quite literally requires that the true label is covered by the prediction set with high probability.\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=5}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nconf_model = conformal_model(model; coverage=coverage, method=:simple_inductive)\nmach = machine(conf_model, X, y)\nfit!(mach, rows=train)\n\n# Conformal Prediction:\nXtest = (x1=[1],x2=[0])\npredict(mach, Xtest)[1]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=6}\n```\nUnivariateFinite{Multiclass{2}}(0=>0.5, 1=>0.5)\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=6}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=7}\nConversely, for low coverage rates, prediction sets can also be empty. For a choice of $(1-\\alpha)$=0.1, for example, the prediction set for our test sample is empty. This is a bit difficult to think about intuitively and I have not yet come across a satisfactory, intuitive interpretation.^[Any thoughts/comments welcome!] When the prediction set is empty, the `predict` call currently returns `missing`:\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=7}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nconf_model = conformal_model(model; coverage=coverage)\nmach = machine(conf_model, X, y)\nfit!(mach, rows=train)\n\n# Conformal Prediction:\npredict(mach, Xtest)[1]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=8}\n```\nmissing\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=8}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\ncov_ = .95\nconf_model = conformal_model(model; coverage=cov_)\nmach = machine(conf_model, X, y)\nfit!(mach, rows=train)\nMarkdown.parse(\"\"\"\nThe following chart shows the resulting predicted probabilities for ``y=1`` (left) and set size (right) for a choice of ``(1-\\\\alpha)``=$cov_.\n\"\"\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=9}\nThe following chart shows the resulting predicted probabilities for $y=1$ (left) and set size (right) for a choice of $(1-\\alpha)$=0.95.\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=9}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nusing Plots\np_proba = contourf(mach.model, mach.fitresult, X, y)\np_set_size = contourf(mach.model, mach.fitresult, X, y; plot_set_size=true)\nplot(p_proba, p_set_size, size=(800,250))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=10}\n![](classification_files/figure-commonmark/cell-10-output-1.svg){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe animation below should provide some more intuition as to what exactly is happening here. It illustrates the effect of the chosen coverage rate on the predicted softmax output and the set size in the two-dimensional feature space. Contours are overlayed with the moon data points (including test data). The two samples highlighted in red, $X_1$ and $X_2$, have been manually added for illustration purposes. Let's look at these one by one.\n\nFirstly, note that $X_1$ (red cross) falls into a region of the domain that is characterized by high predictive uncertainty. It sits right at the bottom-right corner of our class-zero moon 🌜 (orange), a region that is almost entirely enveloped by our class-one moon 🌛 (green). For low coverage rates the prediction set for $X_1$ is empty: on the left-hand side this is indicated by the missing contour for the softmax probability; on the right-hand side we can observe that the corresponding set size is indeed zero. For high coverage rates the prediction set includes both $y=0$ and $y=1$, indicative of the fact that the conformal classifier is uncertain about the true label.\n\nWith respect to $X_2$, we observe that while also sitting on the fringe of our class-zero moon, this sample populates a region that is not fully enveloped by data points from the opposite class. In this region, the underlying atomic classifier can be expected to be more certain about its predictions, but still not highly confident. How is this reflected by our corresponding conformal prediction sets? \n\n::: {.cell execution_count=11}\n``` {.julia .cell-code code-fold=\"true\"}\nXtest_2 = (x1=[-0.5],x2=[0.25])\np̂_2 = pdf(predict(mach, Xtest_2)[1], 0)\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=12}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=13}\nWell, for low coverage rates (roughly $<0.9$) the conformal prediction set does not include $y=0$: the set size is zero (right panel). Only for higher coverage rates do we have $C(X_2)=\\{0\\}$: the coverage rate is high enough to include $y=0$, but the corresponding softmax probability is still fairly low. For example, for $(1-\\alpha)=0.95$ we have $\\hat{p}(y=0|X_2)=0.72.$\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThese two examples illustrate an interesting point: for regions characterized by high predictive uncertainty, conformal prediction sets are typically empty (for low coverage) or large (for high coverage). While set-valued predictions may be something to get used to, this notion is overall intuitive. \n\n::: {#fig-anim .cell execution_count=13}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\n# Setup\ncoverages = range(0.75,1.0,length=5)\nn = 100\nx1_range = range(extrema(X.x1)...,length=n)\nx2_range = range(extrema(X.x2)...,length=n)\n\nanim = @animate for coverage in coverages\n    conf_model = conformal_model(model; coverage=coverage)\n    mach = machine(conf_model, X, y)\n    fit!(mach, rows=train)\n    # Probabilities:\n    p1 = contourf(mach.model, mach.fitresult, X, y)\n    scatter!(p1, Xtest.x1, Xtest.x2, ms=6, c=:red, label=\"X₁\", shape=:cross, msw=6)\n    scatter!(p1, Xtest_2.x1, Xtest_2.x2, ms=6, c=:red, label=\"X₂\", shape=:diamond, msw=6)\n    p2 = contourf(mach.model, mach.fitresult, X, y; plot_set_size=true)\n    scatter!(p2, Xtest.x1, Xtest.x2, ms=6, c=:red, label=\"X₁\", shape=:cross, msw=6)\n    scatter!(p2, Xtest_2.x1, Xtest_2.x2, ms=6, c=:red, label=\"X₂\", shape=:diamond, msw=6)\n    plot(p1, p2, plot_title=\"(1-α)=$(round(coverage,digits=2))\", size=(800,300))\nend\n\ngif(anim, joinpath(www_path,\"classification.gif\"), fps=1)\n```\n:::\n\n\n![](../www/classification.gif)\n\n## Adaptive Sets\n\nInstead of using the simple approach, we can use adaptive prediction sets [@angelopoulos2021gentle]:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=14}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nconf_model = conformal_model(model; coverage=cov_, method=:adaptive_inductive)\nmach = machine(conf_model, X, y)\nfit!(mach, rows=train)\nresults[:adaptive_inductive] = mach\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=15}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nusing Plots\np_proba = contourf(mach.model, mach.fitresult, X, y)\np_set_size = contourf(mach.model, mach.fitresult, X, y; plot_set_size=true)\nplot(p_proba, p_set_size, size=(800,250))\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Evaluation\n\nFor evaluation of conformal predictors we follow @angelopoulos2021gentle (Section 3). As a first step towards adaptiveness (adaptivity), the authors recommend to inspect the set size of conformal predictions. The chart below shows the interval width for the different methods along with the ground truth interval width:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=16}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nplt_list = []\nfor (_mod, mach) in results\n    push!(plt_list, bar(mach.model, mach.fitresult, X; title=String(_mod)))\nend\nplot(plt_list..., size=(800,300))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=17}\n![Prediction interval width.](classification_files/figure-commonmark/fig-setsize-output-1.svg){#fig-setsize}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can also use specific metrics like **empirical coverage** and **size-stratified coverage** to check for correctness and adaptiveness, respectively. To this end, the package provides custom measures that are compatible with `MLJ.jl`. In other words, we can evaluate model performance in true `MLJ.jl` fashion (see [here](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/MLJ.jl/dev/evaluating_model_performance/)). \n\nThe code below runs the evaluation with respect to both metrics, `emp_coverage` and `ssc` for a single conformal machine: \n\n::: {.cell execution_count=17}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\n_mod, mach = first(results)\n_eval = evaluate!(\n    mach,\n    operation=predict,\n    measure=[emp_coverage, ssc]\n)\n# display(_eval)\nprintln(\"Empirical coverage for $(_mod): $(round(_eval.measurement[1], digits=3))\")\nprintln(\"SSC for $(_mod): $(round(_eval.measurement[2], digits=3))\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nEmpirical coverage for adaptive_inductive: 0.962\nSSC for adaptive_inductive: 0.962\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## References\n\n",
