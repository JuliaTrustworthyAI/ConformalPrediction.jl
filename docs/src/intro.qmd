`ConformalPrediction.jl` is a package for Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) through Conformal Prediction (CP) in Julia. It is designed to work with supervised models trained in [MLJ](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/MLJ.jl/dev/). Conformal Prediction is distribution-free, easy-to-understand, easy-to-use and model-agnostic. 

## Disclaimer ‚ö†Ô∏è

This package is in its very early stages of development. In fact, I've built this package largely to gain a better understanding of the topic myself. So far only the most simple approaches have been implemented:

- Naive method for regression.
- LABEL approach for classification [@sadinle2019least].

I have only tested it for a few of the supervised models offered by [MLJ](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/MLJ.jl/dev/).

## Installation üö©

You can install the first stable release from the general registry:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("ConformalPrediction")
```

The development version can be installed as follows:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/pat-alt/ConformalPrediction.jl")
```

## Usage Example - Regression üîç

To illustrate the intended use of the package, let's have a quick look at a simple regression problem. Using [MLJ](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/MLJ.jl/dev/) we first generate some synthetic data and then determine indices for our training, calibration and test data:

```{julia}
using MLJ
X, y = MLJ.make_regression(1000, 2)
train, calibration, test = partition(eachindex(y), 0.4, 0.4)
```

We then train a boosted tree ([EvoTrees](https://github.com/Evovest/EvoTrees.jl)) and follow the standard [MLJ](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/MLJ.jl/dev/) training procedure.

```{julia}
EvoTreeRegressor = @load EvoTreeRegressor pkg=EvoTrees
model = EvoTreeRegressor() 
mach = machine(model, X, y)
fit!(mach, rows=train)
```

To turn our conventional machine into a conformal model, we just need to declare it as such and then calibrate it using our calibration data:

```{julia}
using ConformalPrediction
conf_model = conformal_model(model)
calibrate!(conf_model, selectrows(X, calibration), y[calibration])
```

Predictions can then be computed using the generic `predict` method. The code below produces predictions a random subset of test samples:

```{julia}
#| output: true
predict(conf_model, selectrows(X, rand(test,5)))
```
