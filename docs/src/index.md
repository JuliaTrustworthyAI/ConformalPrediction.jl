# ConformalPrediction

Documentation for [ConformalPrediction.jl](https://github.com/pat-alt/ConformalPrediction.jl).

`ConformalPrediction.jl` is a package for Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) through Conformal Prediction (CP) in Julia. It is designed to work with supervised models trained in [MLJ](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/MLJ.jl/dev/). Conformal Prediction is distribution-free, easy-to-understand, easy-to-use and model-agnostic.

## Disclaimer ‚ö†Ô∏è

This package is in its very early stages of development. In fact, I‚Äôve built this package largely to gain a better understanding of the topic myself. So far only the most simple approaches have been implemented:

- Inductive Conformal Regression
- Inductive Conformal Classification: LABEL approach for classification (Sadinle, Lei, and Wasserman 2019).
- Naive Transductive Regression
- Naive Transductive Classification
- Jackknife Regression

I have only tested it for a few of the supervised models offered by [MLJ](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/MLJ.jl/dev/).

## Installation üö©

You can install the first stable release from the general registry:

``` julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("ConformalPrediction")
```

The development version can be installed as follows:

``` julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/pat-alt/ConformalPrediction.jl")
```

## Usage Example - Inductive Conformal Regression üîç

To illustrate the intended use of the package, let‚Äôs have a quick look at a simple regression problem. Using [MLJ](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/MLJ.jl/dev/) we first generate some synthetic data and then determine indices for our training, calibration and test data:

``` julia
using MLJ
X, y = MLJ.make_regression(1000, 2)
train, test = partition(eachindex(y), 0.4, 0.4)
```

We then train a decision tree ([DecisionTree](https://github.com/Evovest/DecisionTree.jl)) and follow the standard [MLJ](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/MLJ.jl/dev/) training procedure.

``` julia
DecisionTreeRegressor = @load DecisionTreeRegressor pkg=DecisionTree
model = DecisionTreeRegressor() 
```

To turn our conventional machine into a conformal model, we just need to declare it as such by using `conformal_model` wrapper function. The generated conformal model instance can wrapped in data to create a *machine* following standard MLJ convention. By default that function instantiates a `SimpleInductiveRegressor`.

Fitting Inductive Conformal Predictors using `fit!` trains the underlying machine learning model, but it does not compute nonconformity scores. That is because Inductive Conformal Predictors rely on a separate set of calibration data. Consequently, conformal models of type `InductiveConformalModel <: ConformalModel` require a separate calibration step to be trained for conformal prediction. This can be implemented by calling the generic `calibrate!` method on the model instance.

``` julia
using ConformalPrediction
conf_model = conformal_model(model)
mach = machine(conf_model, X, y)
fit!(mach, rows=train)
```

Point predictions for the underlying machine learning model can be computed as always using the generic `predict` method. The code below produces predictions a random subset of test samples:

``` julia
n = 10
Xtest = selectrows(X, first(test,n))
ytest = y[first(test,n)]
yhat = predict(mach, Xtest)
p1 = plot(
    reduce(vcat, map(x -> hcat(x[1],x[2]), yhat)), c=:orange, label="", 
    title=string(typeof(conf_model).name.name)
)
```

## Usage Example - Transductive Conformal Regression üîç

### Naive

``` julia
conf_model = conformal_model(model; method=:naive)
mach = machine(conf_model, X, y)
fit!(mach, rows=train)
yhat = predict(mach, Xtest)
p2 = plot(
    reduce(vcat, map(x -> hcat(x[1],x[2]), yhat)), c=:orange, label="", 
    title=string(typeof(conf_model).name.name)
)
```

### Jackknife

``` julia
conf_model = conformal_model(model; method=:jackknife)
mach = machine(conf_model, X, y)
fit!(mach, rows=train)
yhat = predict(mach, Xtest)
p3 = plot(
    reduce(vcat, map(x -> hcat(x[1],x[2]), yhat)), c=:orange, label="", 
    title=string(typeof(conf_model).name.name)
)
```

``` julia
plot(p1, p2, p3)
```
