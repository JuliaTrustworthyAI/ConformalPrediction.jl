# How to Build a Conformal Chatbot

Large Language Models are all the buzz right now. They are used for a variety of tasks, including text classification, question answering, and text generation. In this tutorial, we will show how to conformalize a transformer language model for text classification. We will use the [Banking77](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04807) dataset [@casanueva2020efficient], which consists of 13,083 queries from 77 intents. On the model side, we will use the [DistilRoBERTa](https://huggingface.co/mrm8488/distilroberta-finetuned-banking77) model, which is a distilled version of [RoBERTa](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11692) [@liu2019roberta] finetuned on the Banking77 dataset.

## Data

The data was downloaded from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/PolyAI/banking77) ü§ó (HF) and split into a proper training, calibration, and test set. All that's left to do is to load the data and preprocess it. We add 1 to the labels to make them 1-indexed (sorry Pythonistas üòú)

```{julia}
# Get labels:
df_labels = CSV.read("dev/artifacts/data/banking77/labels.csv", DataFrame, drop=[1])
labels = df_labels[:,1]

# Get data:
df_train = CSV.read("dev/artifacts/data/banking77/train.csv", DataFrame, drop=[1])
df_cal = CSV.read("dev/artifacts/data/banking77/calibration.csv", DataFrame, drop=[1])
df_full_train = vcat(df_train, df_cal)
train_ratio = round(nrow(df_train)/nrow(df_full_train), digits=2)
df_test = CSV.read("dev/artifacts/data/banking77/test.csv", DataFrame, drop=[1])

# Preprocess data:
queries_train, y_train = collect(df_train.text), categorical(df_train.labels .+ 1)
queries_cal, y_cal = collect(df_cal.text), categorical(df_cal.labels .+ 1)
queries, y = collect(df_full_train.text), categorical(df_full_train.labels .+ 1)
queries_test, y_test = collect(df_test.text), categorical(df_test.labels .+ 1)
```

## HuggingFace Model

The model can be loaded from HF straight into our running Julia session using the [`Transformers.jl`](https://github.com/chengchingwen/Transformers.jl/tree/master) package. Below we load the tokenizer `tkr` and the model `mod`. The tokenizer is used to convert the text into a sequence of integers, which is then fed into the model. The model outputs a hidden state, which is then fed into a classifier to get the logits for each class. Finally, the logits are then passed through a softmax function to get the corresponding predicted probabilities. Below we run a few queries through the model to see how it performs.

```{julia}
#| output: true

# Load model from HF ü§ó:
tkr = hgf"mrm8488/distilroberta-finetuned-banking77:tokenizer"
mod = hgf"mrm8488/distilroberta-finetuned-banking77:ForSequenceClassification"

# Test model:
query = [
    "What is the base of the exchange rates?",
    "Why is my card not working?",
    "My Apple Pay is not working, what should I do?",
]
a = encode(tkr, query)
b = mod.model(a)
c = mod.cls(b.hidden_state)
d = softmax(c.logit)
[labels[i] for i in Flux.onecold(d)]
```

## `MLJ` Interface

Since our package is interfaced to [`MLJ.jl`](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/MLJ.jl/dev/), we need to define a wrapper model that conforms to the `MLJ` interface. In order to add the model for general use, we would probably go through [`MLJFlux.jl`](https://github.com/FluxML/MLJFlux.jl), but for this tutorial, we will make our life easy and simply overload the `MLJBase.fit` and `MLJBase.predict` methods. Since the model from HF is already pre-trained and we are not interested in further fine-tuning, we will simply return the model object in the `MLJBase.fit` method. The `MLJBase.predict` method will then take the model object and the query and return the predicted probabilities. We also need to define the `MLJBase.target_scitype` and `MLJBase.predict_mode` methods. The former tells `MLJ` what the output type of the model is, and the latter can be used to retrieve the label with the highest predicted probability.

```{julia}
struct IntentClassifier <: MLJBase.Probabilistic
    tkr::TextEncoders.AbstractTransformerTextEncoder
    mod::HuggingFace.HGFRobertaForSequenceClassification
end

function IntentClassifier(;
    tokenizer::TextEncoders.AbstractTransformerTextEncoder, 
    model::HuggingFace.HGFRobertaForSequenceClassification,
)
    IntentClassifier(tkr, mod)
end

function get_hidden_state(clf::IntentClassifier, query::Union{AbstractString, Vector{<:AbstractString}})
    token = encode(clf.tkr, query)
    hidden_state = clf.mod.model(token).hidden_state
    return hidden_state
end

# This doesn't actually retrain the model, but it retrieves the classifier object
function MLJBase.fit(clf::IntentClassifier, verbosity, X, y)
    cache=nothing
    report=nothing
    fitresult = (clf = clf.mod.cls, labels = levels(y))
    return fitresult, cache, report
end

function MLJBase.predict(clf::IntentClassifier, fitresult, Xnew)
    output = fitresult.clf(get_hidden_state(clf, Xnew))
    pÃÇ = UnivariateFinite(fitresult.labels,softmax(output.logit)',pool=missing)
    return pÃÇ
end

MLJBase.target_scitype(clf::IntentClassifier) = AbstractVector{<:Finite}

MLJBase.predict_mode(clf::IntentClassifier, fitresult, Xnew) = mode.(MLJBase.predict(clf, fitresult, Xnew))
```

To test that everything is working as expected, we fit the model and generated predictions for a subset of the test data:

```{julia}
clf = IntentClassifier(tkr, mod)
top_n = 10
fitresult, _, _ = MLJBase.fit(clf, 1, nothing, y_test[1:top_n])
@time yÃÇ = MLJBase.predict(clf, fitresult, queries_test[1:top_n]);
```

## Conformal Chatbot

To turn the wrapped, pre-trained model into a conformal intent classifier, we can now rely on standard API calls. We first wrap our atomic model where we also specify the desired coverage rate and method. Since even simple forward passes are computationally expensive for our (small) LLM, we rely on Simple Inductive Conformal Classification.

```{.julia}
#| eval: false

conf_model = conformal_model(clf; coverage=0.95, method=:simple_inductive, train_ratio=train_ratio)
mach = machine(conf_model, queries, y)
@time fit!(mach)
Serialization.serialize("dev/artifacts/models/banking77/simple_inductive.jls", mach)
```

Finally, we use our conformal LLM to build a simple and yet powerful chatbot that runs directly in the Julia REPL. Without dwelling on the details too much, the `conformal_chatbot` works as follows:

1.  Prompt user to explain their intent.
2.  Feed user input through conformal LLM and present the output to the user.
3.  If the conformal prediction sets includes more than one label, prompt the user to either refine their input or choose one of the options included in the set.

```{julia}
mach = Serialization.deserialize("dev/artifacts/models/banking77/simple_inductive.jls")

function prediction_set(mach, query::String)
    pÃÇ = MLJBase.predict(mach, query)[1]
    probs = pdf.(pÃÇ, collect(1:77))
    in_set = findall(probs .!= 0)
    labels_in_set = labels[in_set]
    probs_in_set = probs[in_set]
    _order = sortperm(-probs_in_set)
    plt = UnicodePlots.barplot(labels_in_set[_order], probs_in_set[_order], title="Possible Intents")
    return labels_in_set, plt
end

function conformal_chatbot()
    println("üëã Hi, I'm a Julia, your conformal chatbot. I'm here to help you with your banking query. Ask me anything or type 'exit' to exit ...\n")
    completed = false
    queries = ""
    while !completed
        query = readline()
        queries = queries * "," * query
        labels, plt = prediction_set(mach, queries)
        if length(labels) > 1
            println("ü§î Hmmm ... I can think of several options here. If any of these applies, simply type the corresponding number (e.g. '1' for the first option). Otherwise, can you refine your question, please?\n")
            println(plt)
        else
            println("ü•≥ I think you mean $(labels[1]). Correct?")
        end

        # Exit:
        if query == "exit"
            println("üëã Bye!")
            break
        end
        if query ‚àà string.(collect(1:77))
            println("üëç Great! You've chosen '$(labels[parse(Int64, query)])'. I'm glad I could help you. Have a nice day!")
            completed = true
        end
    end
end
```

Below we show the output for two example queries. The first one is very ambiguous. As expected, the size of the prediction set is therefore large. 

```{julia}
#| output: true

ambiguous_query = "transfer mondey?"
prediction_set(mach, ambiguous_query)[2]
```

The more refined version of the prompt yields a smaller prediction set: less ambiguous prompts result in lower predictive uncertainty. 

```{julia}
#| output: true

refined_query = "I tried to transfer money to my friend, but it failed."
prediction_set(mach, refined_query)[2]
```

Below we include a short demo video that shows the REPL-based chatbot in action.

## Final Remarks
