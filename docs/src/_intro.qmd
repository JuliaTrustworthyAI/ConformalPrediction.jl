`ConformalPrediction.jl` is a package for Predictive Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) through Conformal Prediction (CP) in Julia. It is designed to work with supervised models trained in [MLJ](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/MLJ.jl/dev/) [@blaom2020mlj]. Conformal Prediction is easy-to-understand, easy-to-use and model-agnostic and it works under minimal distributional assumptions.

## 📖 Background

Don't worry, we're not about to deep-dive into methodology. But just to give you a high-level description of Conformal Prediction (CP) upfront:

> Conformal prediction (a.k.a. conformal inference) is a user-friendly paradigm for creating statistically rigorous uncertainty sets/intervals for the predictions of such models. Critically, the sets are valid in a distribution-free sense: they possess explicit, non-asymptotic guarantees even without distributional assumptions or model assumptions.

Intuitively, CP works under the premise of turning heuristic notions of uncertainty into rigorous uncertainty estimates through repeated sampling or the use of dedicated calibration data. 

![Conformal Prediction in action: prediction intervals at varying coverage rates. As coverage grows, so does the width of the prediction interval.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pat-alt/pat-alt.github.io/main/blog/posts/conformal-regression/www/medium.gif)

The animation above is lifted from a small blog [post](https://www.paltmeyer.com/blog/posts/conformal-regression/) that introduces Conformal Prediction and this package in the context of regression. It shows how the prediction interval and the test points that it covers varies in size as the user-specified coverage rate changes.

## 🚩 Installation 

You can install the latest stable release from the general registry:

```{.julia}
using Pkg
Pkg.add("ConformalPrediction")
```

The development version can be installed as follows:

```{.julia}
using Pkg
Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/juliatrustworthyai/ConformalPrediction.jl")
```

## 🔍 Usage Example 

To illustrate the intended use of the package, let's have a quick look at a simple regression problem. We first generate some synthetic data and then determine indices for our training and test data using [MLJ](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/MLJ.jl/dev/):

```{julia}
using MLJ

# Inputs:
N = 600
xmax = 3.0
using Distributions
d = Uniform(-xmax, xmax)
X = rand(d, N)
X = reshape(X, :, 1)

# Outputs:
noise = 0.5
fun(X) = sin(X)
ε = randn(N) .* noise
y = @.(fun(X)) + ε
y = vec(y)

# Partition:
train, test = partition(eachindex(y), 0.4, 0.4, shuffle=true)
```

We then import Symbolic Regressor ([`SymbolicRegression.jl`](https://github.com/MilesCranmer/SymbolicRegression.jl)) following the standard [MLJ](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/MLJ.jl/dev/) procedure.

```{julia}
regressor = @load SRRegressor pkg=SymbolicRegression
model = regressor(
    niterations=50,
    binary_operators=[+, -, *],
    unary_operators=[sin],
)
```

To turn our conventional model into a conformal model, we just need to declare it as such by using `conformal_model` wrapper function. The generated conformal model instance can wrapped in data to create a *machine*. Finally, we proceed by fitting the machine on training data using the generic `fit!` method:

```{julia}
using ConformalPrediction
conf_model = conformal_model(model)
mach = machine(conf_model, X, y)
fit!(mach, rows=train)
```

Predictions can then be computed using the generic `predict` method. The code below produces predictions for the first `n` samples. Each tuple contains the lower and upper bound for the prediction interval. 

```{julia}
#| output: true
show_first = 5
Xtest = selectrows(X, test)
ytest = y[test]
ŷ = predict(mach, Xtest)
ŷ[1:show_first]
```

For simple models like this one, we can call a custom `Plots` recipe on our instance, fit result and data to generate the chart below:

```{julia}
#| output: true

using Plots
zoom = 0
plt = plot(mach.model, mach.fitresult, Xtest, ytest, lw=5, zoom=zoom, observed_lab="Test points")
xrange = range(-xmax+zoom,xmax-zoom,length=N)
plot!(plt, xrange, @.(fun(xrange)), lw=2, ls=:dash, colour=:darkorange, label="Ground truth")
```

```{julia}
#| eval: false
#| echo: false

theme(:lime)

Xtest = selectrows(X, test)
ytest = y[test]

max_z = 5
anim = @animate for z in 0:0.1:max_z

    z = -z

    # Test points:
    xleft = -xmax + z
    xright = xmax - z
    global Xtest = vcat(xleft, Xtest, xright)
    yleft =  fun(xleft) .+ randn(1) .* noise
    yright =  fun(xright) .+ randn(1) .* noise
    global ytest = vcat(yleft, ytest, yright)

    # Plot:
    plt = plot(mach.model, mach.fitresult, Xtest, ytest, 
        lw=5, zoom=zoom, observed_lab="Test points", dpi=300, legend=false, axis=true,
        size=(800,400))
    xrange = range(-xmax-max_z,xmax+max_z,length=N)
    plot!(plt, xrange, @.(fun(xrange)), 
        lw=2, ls=:dash, label="Ground truth", xlim=extrema(xrange), ylim=(-2.0,2.0))
end

gif(anim, fps=10)
```

We can evaluate the conformal model using the standard [MLJ](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/MLJ.jl/dev/) workflow with a custom performance measure. You can use either `emp_coverage` for the overall empirical coverage (correctness) or `ssc` for the size-stratified coverage rate (adaptiveness).

```{julia}
#| output: true

_eval = evaluate!(mach; measure=[emp_coverage, ssc], verbosity=0)
display(_eval)
println("Empirical coverage: $(round(_eval.measurement[1], digits=3))")
println("SSC: $(round(_eval.measurement[2], digits=3))")
```

## 🔁 Status 

This package is in its early stages of development and therefore still subject to changes to the core architecture and API. 

### Implemented Methodologies

The following CP approaches have been implemented:

**Regression**:

- Inductive 
- Naive Transductive 
- Jackknife 
- Jackknife+ 
- Jackknife-minmax
- CV+
- CV-minmax

**Classification**:

- Inductive
- Naive Transductive 
- Adaptive Inductive

The package has been tested for the following supervised models offered by [MLJ](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/MLJ.jl/dev/).

**Regression**:

```{julia}
#| output: true
keys(tested_atomic_models[:regression])
```

**Classification**:

```{julia}
#| output: true
keys(tested_atomic_models[:classification])
```

### Implemented Evaluation Metrics

To evaluate conformal predictors we are typically interested in correctness and adaptiveness. The former can be evaluated by looking at the empirical coverage rate, while the latter can be assessed through metrics that address the conditional coverage [@angelopoulos2021gentle]. To this end, the following metrics have been implemented:

- `emp_coverage` (empirical coverage)
- `ssc` (size-stratified coverage)

There is also a simple `Plots.jl` recipe that can be used to inspect the set sizes. In the regression case, the interval width is stratified into discrete bins for this purpose:

```{julia}
#| output: true

bar(mach.model, mach.fitresult, X)
```
