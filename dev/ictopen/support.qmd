## Creating an Open-Source Ecosystem for Trustworthy AI in Julia {-}

This supporting document provides brief descriptions of the various packages that form part of our Trustworthy AI ecosystem for Julia. We will use an extended version of this [notebook](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fonsp/pluto-on-binder/v0.19.12?urlpath=pluto/open?url=https%253A%252F%252Fraw.githubusercontent.com%252Fpat-alt%252FConformalPrediction.jl%252Fmain%252Fdocs%252Fpluto%252Fintro.jl) for demo purposes (may take a few minutes to load).

## [`ConformalPrediction.jl`](https://github.com/juliatrustworthyai/ConformalPrediction.jl)

[`ConformalPrediction.jl`](https://github.com/juliatrustworthyai/ConformalPrediction.jl) is a package for Predictive Uncertainty Quantification through Conformal Prediction for Machine Learning models trained in [`MLJ.jl`](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/MLJ.jl/dev/).

> Conformal prediction (a.k.a. conformal inference) is a user-friendly paradigm for creating statistically rigorous uncertainty sets/intervals for the predictions of such models.

Intuitively, CP works under the premise of turning heuristic notions of uncertainty into rigorous uncertainty estimates through repeated sampling or the use of dedicated calibration data. @fig-cp demonstrates this notion for the regression case.

## [`LaplaceRedux.jl`](https://github.com/pat-alt/LaplaceRedux.jl)

[`LaplaceRedux.jl`](https://github.com/pat-alt/LaplaceRedux.jl) is a package that facilitates Effortless Bayesian Deep Learning through Laplace Approximation for Deep Neural Networks built in `Flux.jl`. It implements the ideas presented in @daxberger2021laplace. @fig-laplace shows a Bayesian Prediction interval for a Deep Neural Network with Laplace Approximation that was built and trained in `LaplaceRedux.jl`.

## [`CounterfactualExplanations.jl`](https://github.com/pat-alt/CounterfactualExplanations.jl)

[`CounterfactualExplanations.jl`](https://github.com/pat-alt/CounterfactualExplanations.jl) is a package for generating Counterfactual Explanations and Algorithmic Recourse in Julia. In @fig-ce1 we have generated a Counterfactual Explanation for turning a cat into a dog (a toy example): as the tail length decreases and the height increases, the cat traverses through the feature space across the decision boundary of the underlying classifier. @fig-ce2 applies the same underlying principles to MNIST data: it demonstrates which pixels need to be perturbed in order for the underlying image classifier to predict 'four' (4) instead of 'nine' (9).
