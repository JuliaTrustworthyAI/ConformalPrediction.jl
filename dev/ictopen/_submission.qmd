**Title**: Creating an Open-Source Ecosystem for Trustworthy AI in Julia

**Abstract**: The Julia Programming Language is not only performant but also uniquely transparent, accessible and extensible. Open-source development in Julia's Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) space has been very active in recent years. Libraries like [`MLJ.jl`](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/MLJ.jl/dev/) and [`Flux.jl`](https://fluxml.ai/) are just two great examples testifying to these community efforts. As developers gradually build up an AI ecosystem, it is important to also pay attention to the risks and challenges facing AI today. We aim to address this need by creating an ecosystem for Trustworthy AI composed of various interlinked packages: [`CounterfactualExplanations.jl`](https://github.com/pat-alt/CounterfactualExplanations.jl) and [`LaplaceRedux.jl`](https://github.com/pat-alt/LaplaceRedux.jl) can be used to generate Counterfactual Explanations and Predictive Uncertainty estimates for Deep Neural Networks trained in `Flux.jl`; [`ConformalPrediction.jl`](https://github.com/juliatrustworthyai/ConformalPrediction.jl) facilitates Predictive Uncertainty estimation for any supervised machine learning model available in `MLJ.jl`. We will use a fully reactive `Pluto.jl` ðŸŽˆ notebook to demonstrate how our packages have been integrated into the broader Julia ecosystem. In a fully interactive manner, we will take the audience through a conventional ML workflow. Through live-coding examples, we will illustrate that our Trustworthy AI ecosystem makes it remarkably easy for practitioners to understand the behaviour and vulnerabilities of their models.
